# Agriculture-with-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Modeling-for-Crop-Price-Forecasting-and-Analysis
Historical agricultural data is preprocessed, addressing missing values, scaling features, and splitting data for crops like rice, wheat, maize, and chickpea. Random Forest models are trained/tested per crop, with MSE and RÂ² ensuring accuracy. Models forecast crop prices using soil, weather, and trends, aiding data-driven decisions.
